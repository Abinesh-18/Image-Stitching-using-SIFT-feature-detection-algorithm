# Image-Stitching-using-SIFT-feature-detection-algorithm
The goal of this task is to experiment with image stitching methods. Two images may have the same background but different foreground. For example, a moving person may be moving in the scene. The two images must be stitched into one image eliminating foreground objects that move in the scene. 

In this project there are 2 tasks performed:
1) Background Stitching: Two images with same background, but different foregrounds are
provided. The task is to stitch the two images given and eliminate the foreground objects
2) Image Panorama: A set of 4 images are given which needs to be stitched together to create one
panoramic image
