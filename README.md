# Image-Stitching-using-SIFT-feature-detection-algorithm
The goal of this task is to experiment with image stitching methods. Two images may have the same background but different foreground. For example, a moving person may be moving in the scene. You need to stitch the two images into one image eliminating foreground objects that move in the scene.
